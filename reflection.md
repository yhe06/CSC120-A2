What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first, I was very confused on this assignment and realized that I needed to relearn some Python fundamentals I forgot. I also inquired Mikcaela for help outside of class.

I have everything working I believe, however I am unsure about calling the computers by using "inventory[0]", it seems rather messy. And I am more unsure about this because when I try to put like "inventory[3]" for example (a computer that doesn't exist), the terminal just tells me it is out of range rather than printing my error message.

My advice would be READ everything and watch the video posted on Moodle.
